# Decent_Chat
Today, online communication is accessible to every person in the world, most popularly, in the form of textual messaging. With this advantage comes some challenges, online abuse and harrasement has prevailed in such communication. People often get hate speech, comments and face abuse in the digital world. This problem can be easily solved using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. So, for our semester project, we decided to develop an offensive language detection model integrated in a chat app named "Decent Chat." We have use Logistic Regression for binary classification of our messages, offensive and non-offensive. We have also made a reporting mechanism to report such offensive language detected using SMTP to the concerned authority. Here chat messages is our feature and offensiveness is our target.
